        <h2>Learning Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Web development has been one of the most exciting units I've tacked so
          far. As a painter, I love creating artistic masterpieces and to me web
          design is a form of digital art.
        </p>
        <p>
          I loved the use of color and subtle animation, and learning about web
          dev trends from the online community has been refreshing and
          reassuring <code>#stackoverflow</code>.
          <br />
          I love that I was able to borrow design elements from my favorite
          desktop applications and instantly create mirror designs from just
          looking. Markup gives you limitless opportunities to create and the
          learning journey is far from over.
        </p>
        <p>Bottom-Line >> I love playing with <code>css</code>!!!</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Github had a bit of a leaning curve, but I managed to work around it
            through rigorous research
          </li>
          <li>
            Responsive design was a bit of a challenging as I had to use
            multiple browser windows for navigation. I also had to correct last
            minute bugs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Browser compatibility needed some getting used to; debugging chrome
            and firefox.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <!-- Development Overview -->
      <section>
        <h2>Development Overview</h2>
        <p>My development cycle is split into various stages:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Wire-Framing</li>
          <li>Templating</li>
          <li>Hydration</li>
        </ol>
        <!-- Wire-Framing -->
        <h3>Wire-Framing</h3>
        <p>
          My initial commit contained empty <code>html</code> files and empty
          folders because I had a feeling I knew what to do with those later on.
        </p>
        <img class="retain" src="./assets/screenshots/folders.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          The <code>html</code> files each had comments about the instructions
          for each page so that I can keep track of what the question demanded
        </p>
        <br />
        <img
          src="./assets/screenshots/html-comments.png"
          alt=""
          class="retain"
        />
        <!-- Templating -->
        <h3>Templating</h3>
        <p>
          Each page demands a consistent layout hence I had to create the same
          <code>nav</code> layout an work out the styling before copying and
          pasting it on each page.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img
          src="./assets/screenshots/nav-template.png"
          alt=""
          class="retain"
        />
        <br />
        First I solved the layout on wide screens then add reponsive design for
        smaller screens using the <code>@media</code> query.
        <br />
        <img src="./assets/screenshots/nav-css.png" alt="" class="retain" />
        <img
          src="./assets/screenshots/responsive-nav-css.png"
          alt=""
          class="retain"
        />
        <br />
        <p>This helped form the burger menu</p>
        <br />
        <img
          src="./assets/screenshots/burger-dropdown.png"
          alt=""
          class="retain"
        />
        <br />
        <p>
          But at this point I only had pages with single <code>h1</code> tags to
          differentiate them, but it gave way to the next step >> Hydration
        </p>
        <!-- Hydration -->
        <h3>Hydration</h3>
        <p>
          This was the part where I had to fill each file with its respective
          markup, carefully adding the relevant tags representing each article.
          <br />
          Every page hydration called for its own git <code>commit</code>.
        </p>

        <!-- Version Control -->
        <h3>Version Control</h3>
        <p>
          Initially I was working on the main branch <code>master</code> and
          making direct commits, but I learnt that this is a bad practice.
          <br />
          My first secondary branch was called <code>midguard</code> which was
          inspired by the Norse creation myth to symbolise my hydration. I made
          multiple pull requests to merge with the main branch. I'm the only one
          working on this projects so there weren't any conflicts.
          <br />
          My next branch was <code>validation</code> which I used to make
          commits around the content validation of both my markup and
          stylesheets.
        </p>

        <!-- Debugging -->
        <h3>Debugging</h3>
        <p>
          I used <b>firefox</b> and <b>google-chrome</b> to test browser
          compatibility to ensure I never missed a single
          <code>-webkit</code> prefix in my stylesheet.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/screenshots/webkit.png" alt="" class="retain" />
        <br />
        <p>
          I also used the reponsive <b>DevTools</b> control to test
          responsiveness for smaller screen sizes.
        </p>

      <!-- Validation Section -->
      <section>
        <h2>Validation</h2>
        <p>
          I needed to do some cleaning up of meta tags for the file encoding and
          remove spaces from file names to pass the
          <code><a href="https://validator.w3.org">validator.w3.org</a></code>
          check.
        </p>
