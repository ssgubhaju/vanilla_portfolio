        <h3>Defining the project structure</h3>
        <p>
          Wireframing is the most important step in the software development
          cycle. My teacher once said that
          <i>"the more you delay coding the faster you finish development"</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My initial commit contained empty files and folders that acted as
          entries into which I could populate later once I ahd decided on how to
          go about the design
          <br />
          So empty <code>html</code> files for each route, assets, script and
          styles folder for <code>jpegs</code>, <code>javascript</code> and
          <code>css</code> files respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good code is readable code, which is why I chose to use the
          <b>Prettier</b> library for code formatting to maintain a coherent
          aesthetic for every file, making the development experience a tad bit
          less chaotic.

        <h3>Templating & Consistency</h3>
        <p>
          Maintaining consistent design across multiple pages, particularly for
          the navigation can be a challenge. Every page needs to look and feel
          the same and hence redundacy is inevitable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The simplest way of solving this problem with as little redundancy as
          possible is simply to establish your objective and solve the first
          piece before copy and paste to the rest of these files
          <br />
          For the <code>nav</code> issue, I had to solve the responsiveness
          issue for just the home page and then copy over the markup as a
          template to the rest of the files, giving it that consistent and
          intentional feel.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the files share a <code>global.css</code> stylesheet to give them
          the same look and feel without much of a hustle, and each file has
          their own specifications in a separate stylesheet; creating a neat and
          convenient <b>Separation of Concerns</b>.
          <br />
          The <code>global.css</code> file defines a list of CSS variable that I
          used in each page to maintain that uniform aesthetic without
          unnecessary redundancy.
        </p>

        <h3>Markup Validity</h3>

        <p>
          It is important to ensure that your markup is valid and SEO friendly.
          Despite the fact that all markup is inherrently the same, and that you
          can use the humble <code>div</code> to represent a heading tag, or a
          <code>span</code> in place of an <code>i</code> tag and style it using
          CSS classes, it is still crucial to use the right tool for the job.
          <br />
          Valid markup doesn't only help search engines, it is a crucial tool in
          web accessibility, allowing users to locate different sections of your
          code neatly.
        </p>
        <p>
          My markup conveniention is splitting essential sections of the code to
          their individual functions; <code>nav</code> then
          <code>main</code> then <code>footer</code> for instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is crucial to add <code>meta</code> tags for the required metadata
          especially for viewport scaling, and finally,
          <b>KeepItSimpleStudid</b>. No one likes a bloated site so restrict
          your site to the minimum requirements
