## Instructions

You are tasked with developing a portfolio site with at least five pages:

1. *index.html* (home page). The first page is the home page which introduces the site’s it introduces the site’s purpose (portfolio), it could have a brief bio, tagline, welcome (like “Hi, I’m John” or site purpose.

2. *portfolio.html* (Portfolio page) this page will contain placeholder images that will eventually be replaced with your work from term 2 and other modules where you make things worthy of your portfolio. You need to use columns on this page to demonstrate your skill.

3. *contact.html* (Contact page) this page will contain your contact information and a form. Note: For CSY1018 you make the form launch the user’s email program. Although this is not strictly the best way of working, you won’t be able to implement a better solution as that requires a server-side language such as PHP which we will not use in this module.

4. *blog.html* (Blog page) You will use columns on this page to demonstrate your skill. The content should be largely typical for a blog and contain three entries around your progress on the assignment.

5. *sitereport.html* (Site report)
   - The report (250 word minimum) will contain your experience of learning the basics of web development, coding, design and debugging process. This should be a log or an informal conversation explaining your development experience. Include your ups and downs!
   - A ‘reflective discussion of your module experience’
   - You will set out in the report the development of the site over the term and focus on both the technical and design of sites user interface (UI). Explain the design decisions you made, how you chose the font/colours and link to any sites which influenced your website’s design.
   - Format the report with relevant sections, dates and headings.
   - You should include images of your progress and document any changes you made over time.
   - On this page, include screenshots of validation reports showing that your pages HTML and CSS validate


## Additional Considerations
- Each page should use the same overall website layout and you should be able to reach each page from a navigation menu which is consistent across each page of the website.

- Your site must be responsive, it must work correctly on mobile and desktop browsers and use appropriate techniques for doing so such as hiding the menu behind a hamburger icon.You should ensure that you use the correct tags where appropriate. You will lose marks for using, for example, `<div class=”nav”>` instead of the correct `<nav>` tag!

- In addition, your code should be uploaded to GitHub with regular commits logging your changes
throughout the term. **Failing to upload the site to GitHub or Uploading the site in a single commit at the end of the term will result in a fail grade!**
